        <p><a href="Q112661379.html">Atwood's Tavern</a> closed at the end of March, after 16 years in business.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> I've lived in the Boston area for just about two years now, making this the first local venue closure that's impacted me personally.</p> 
        <p>I only went to Atwood's Tavern once, but it was part of a Really Great Night Out. Granted, this was more about the company and the circumstances than Atwood's itself; still, it's a nice memory made possible by Atwood's unique location, booking policies, and ambience.</p>
        <p>So: June 17, 2022 - somewhat miraculously, a new friend/ambiguous romantic prospect offered to go with me to see an Oasis tribute act at <a href="Q115096454.html">Sonia</a>. I had seen that Jon Langford and Sally Timms (of the <a href="https://mekons.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">Mekons</a>) and <a href="https://thesadies.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">The Sadies</a> were meant to be playing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220602003521/https://atwoodstavern.com/events/2022/6/17/jon-langford-sally-timms-and-the-sadies" target="_blank">Atwood's Tavern that same night</a> and was keeping that late show in my back pocket as a potential secondary location if the night went well. The sun hadn't even completely set by the time the Faux-asis gig (poorly attended, but fun) let out; we stopped by Toscanini's and then headed to Atwood's - a perfect distance to walk from Central Square on an early summer evening while slightly tipsy.</p>
        <p>Atwood's was surprisingly packed with an unsurprisingly elderly audience; not sure if the aging punk legends or the Canadian alt-country mainstays were the bigger draw here. Jon Langford and Sally Timms were charming, and the size and layout of the venue made their between-song banter feel extra intimate, like they were just casually chatting with us. The Sadies were subdued, especially compared to when I saw them in Montreal in 2018 - we realized later that Dallas Good, one of the founding members, had died unexpectedly just four months prior to this show.</p>

        <p>I sporadically checked Atwood's event listings and meant to go again, but nothing was ever quite as compelling as that one show, when everything seemed to align and I was pretty much able to manifest the ideal version of the night that I had in my head. Most of the acts were too roots/Americana/singer-songwriter-with-acoustic-guitar for me, although totally on-point for the vibe of the venue (that wood paneling!). There was always that one family band whose <a href="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/58e45c226b8f5bebdb375991/1654398936590-KDVIHIPJXDE1ZK7Z5CWL/mondaytimkelly.jpg" target="_blank">"press photo"</a> was clearly taken at the Argenziano School playground. Instrumental prog-rock weirdos <a href="https://clamb.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">Clamb</a> had a show in the final month, though, and I should have gone.</p>

        <p>There's still hope for live music in that spot - apparently Remnant Brewing will open a branch in the same space and intends to keep booking bands.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> Alas, this probably means no more cocktail menu.</p>
