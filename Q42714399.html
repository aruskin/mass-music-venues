        <p id="venue-wikipedia">The Holyoke Opera House was a theatre operating in Holyoke, Massachusetts during the 19th and early 20th centuries. Built in 1877, and christened on March 25, 1878, the theater was built by then-mayor William Whiting who privately-funded its construction along with the adjoining &#34;Windsor House&#34; hotel. Designed by architect Clarence Sumner Luce, its interior was decorated by painter and designer Frank Hill Smith, who is best known today for the frescoes in the House of Representatives&#39; chamber in the Massachusetts State House, and whose commission for the venue&#39;s main hall paintings has been described by the American Art Directory and historian John Tauranac as one of his definitive works.</p>
